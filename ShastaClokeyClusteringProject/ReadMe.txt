Hello!
Below are instructions on how to run my super sweet clustering methods for both the measFeats and wavCurr data sets.

1. Open the "clusteringProjectCulmination.m" script file.
2. Run the script and witness the magic as 6 plots mysteriously apear before your eyes.
	-The plots are labeled by method and by dataset.
	-The plots are all depicting a classificaiton using my two favorite collumns from the datasets.
	-I use columns 4 and 6 when classifying and plotting measFeats data.
	-I use columns 1 and 2 when classifying and plotting wavCurr data.
3. Enjoy the facinating error probabilities as they apear in the command window.
	-The probabilites are separated by clustering method and by dataset.
	-The first probability shown in each section correlates with the training dataset. 
	-The second probability shown correlates with the test dataset.
	-Each section shows the probabilities of error in the label assignments using first every collumn in the data set and 
	 second only my two favorite columns.
