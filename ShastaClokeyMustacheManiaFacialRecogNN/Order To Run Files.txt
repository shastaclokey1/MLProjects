Here lies the list of steps, burried within the depths of github, required to slap sweet mustaches on George W. Bush!

1) Move all pictures within folders titled 'bush pics #' into the main project folder.

2) Open and run 'findingFacialFeatures.m' to utilize the power of the Viola Jones feature-recognition alg.

3) Open and run 'findingStacheLocations.m' to generate the necessary data(.mat) files for stache locations.

4) Open and run 'imageOverlay.m'. Witness the beauty as mustaches magically apear on the face of our former president.

5) Open and run 'stacheNN.m' to train the convolution neural network which will be used to target and recognize staches.

6) Open and run 'nnDisplay.m' to see how well(or poorly) the neural network performed at placing GW's new mustache

7) Bask in the glory of mustache mania and spread the laughter!
